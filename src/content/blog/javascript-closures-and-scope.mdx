Have you read my **[Functional Programming in JavaScript](/blog/functional-programming-in-javascript/)** guide? In that post we saw how pure functions stay reliable when they do not depend on outside state.

Closures add a powerful twist, a function can **remember** the place where it was created. That memory lets us hide private data, make one-off helpers, and avoid global variables.

By the end of this post you will:

1. Draw the scope chain for any piece of code.
2. Explain why a function still sees variables after its outer function finished.
3. Build real helpers: a private counter and a `once` utility.

Open your console and follow along.

## 0. Closures in sixty seconds

A **closure** is the combination of:

1. A **function**.
2. The **scope** where that function was defined.

Whenever you create a function, JavaScript quietly stores a reference to its surrounding variables. When you later call the function - even in another place - it can reach back to that original scope.

Put differently: **functions carry their backpack of variables with them**.

```js
function outer() {
    const secret = "🕵️‍♂️";
    return function inner() {
        console.log(secret); // still sees secret
    };
}

const reveal = outer(); // outer finished but inner remembers
reveal(); // 🕵️‍♂️
```

## 1. Visualising the scope chain

Each function call gets its own **execution context** that holds local variables. If a variable is not found locally, the engine walks **outward** one level at a time. This linked list is the **scope chain**.

```js
const a = "global";

function first() {
    const b = "first";

    function second() {
        const c = "second";
        console.log(a, b, c);
    }

    second();
}

first(); // global first second
```

1. `second` looks for `a` → not local.
2. Walks up to `first` → still not found.
3. Walks up again to the global scope → found!

Closures simply **freeze** that chain for later use.

## 2. Practical pattern - private counters

Because a closure keeps private data alive, we can create functions that manage their own state without exposing it.

```js
function makeCounter() {
    let count = 0; // private

    return {
        next() {
            return ++count;
        },
        reset() {
            count = 0;
        },
    };
}

const counter = makeCounter();
console.log(counter.next()); // 1
console.log(counter.next()); // 2
console.log(counter.count); // undefined - cannot access directly
```

No global variables, no `this`, just a tidy function with its own memory.

### Build your own `counter`

Try re-writing `makeCounter` so it returns a single function that both increments **and** returns the value.

```js
const makeSimpleCounter = () => {
    let n = 0;
    return () => ++n;
};

const inc = makeSimpleCounter();
console.log(inc()); // 1
console.log(inc()); // 2
```

Same idea, fewer characters.

## 3. Practical pattern - run only once

A common need: run an expensive setup exactly once.

```js
function once(fn) {
    let done = false;
    let result;

    return function (...args) {
        if (!done) {
            result = fn.apply(this, args);
            done = true;
        }
        return result;
    };
}

const init = once(() => {
    console.log("Initialising…");
    return 42;
});

init(); // Initialising…  → 42
init(); //                  → 42 (silent)
```

`once` keeps `done` and `result` alive between calls, but only inside the returned function.

## 4. Common gotchas

### 4.1 Loops with `var`

Before `let` and `const`, developers hit a classic trap:

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 0);
}
// 3 3 3
```

`var` is function-scoped, so all callbacks share the same `i`. Replace with `let` and the block scope gives each loop its own value.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 0);
}
// 0 1 2
```

### 4.2 Leaking memory by accident

A closure keeps variables alive **as long as the function is reachable**. Return large objects or DOM nodes only when needed or you may block garbage collection.

---

## 5. Testing your understanding

Try answering without running the code. Then verify in the console.

```js
function makeAdder(x) {
    return (y) => x + y;
}

const add10 = makeAdder(10);
console.log(add10(5));
// What happens if we later set x = 99? Why?
```

Spoiler: the closure captured the **value** of `x` inside `makeAdder`, not the external variable after the function finished.

## Where to next?

- Convert an event handler into a closure that remembers options.
- Refactor a module that uses a global variable into a factory like `makeCounter`.
- Share this guide with a friend who still sprinkles `var self = this` in callbacks.
