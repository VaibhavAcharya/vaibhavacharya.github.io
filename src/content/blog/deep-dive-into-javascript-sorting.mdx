Have you read my **[Deep Dive into JavaScript Array Methods](/blog/deep-dive-into-javascript-array-methods/)**? In that post we used helpers like `map` and `reduce`.

Today we look at another helper: **`Array.prototype.sort`**. Sorting sounds easy, but JavaScript has a few hidden rules.

By the end of this post you will:

1. Predict the exact order produced by the default sort.
2. Write solid compare functions for numbers, strings, and objects.
3. Explain what a **stable** sort is and why it matters.

Open your console and follow along.

## 0. `sort` in sixty seconds

If you remember nothing else, remember these facts:

- No compare function? Every value is cast to a string and compared by UTF-16 code points.
- A compare function must return a negative, zero, or positive number.
- Since 2019 every engine guarantees the result is **stable**.
- Behind the scenes browsers use **TimSort** which is a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort.

The rest of this post expands those points with examples you can paste into the console.

## 1. The default sort turns items into strings

If you call `sort()` with **no compare function**, JavaScript first makes every item a **string**. It then orders those strings by UTF-16 code units.

```js
[10, 2, 30].sort(); // ["10", "2", "30"]
```

`"10"` comes before `"2"` because the first character `"1"` is smaller than `"2"`.  
Good for names, bad for numbers.

### The right way to sort numbers

```js
const nums = [10, 2, 30];

nums.sort((a, b) => a - b); // [2, 10, 30]  ascending
nums.sort((a, b) => b - a); // [30, 10, 2]  descending
```

A compare function must return:

- a **negative** number if `a` should come first,
- **zero** if their order does not matter,
- a **positive** number if `b` should come first.

## 2. Simple compare patterns

### 2.1 Boolean shortcut for numbers

```js
const asc = (a, b) => (a > b) - (a < b);
```

True is `1`, false is `0`. Subtracting gives `1`, `0`, or `-1`.

### 2.2 Locale-aware strings

```js
const names = ["Åke", "Zoë", "Émile", "Ana"];
names.sort((a, b) => a.localeCompare(b, "en", { sensitivity: "base" }));
```

`localeCompare` knows about accents and many alphabets.

### 2.3 One key on objects

```js
const users = [
    { id: 3, name: "Ada" },
    { id: 1, name: "Charles" },
    { id: 2, name: "Grace" },
];

users.sort((a, b) => a.id - b.id);
```

### 2.4 Two keys (tie-breaker)

```js
users.sort((a, b) =>
    a.name === b.name ? a.id - b.id : a.name.localeCompare(b.name),
);
```

If the names are equal we fall back to the id.

## 3. Stable vs. unstable

A **stable** sort keeps items that compare as equal in their _original_ order.  
Since **ES2019** JavaScript engines must give you a stable sort.

```js
const items = [
    { category: "fruit", name: "🍎" },
    { category: "veg", name: "🥕" },
    { category: "fruit", name: "🍌" },
];

items.sort((a, b) => a.category.localeCompare(b.category));
// fruit 🍎, fruit 🍌, veg 🥕   (the two fruits stay in order)
```

## Where to next?

- Try `localeCompare` with different locales and options.
- Benchmark the default sort against a numeric comparator on large arrays.
- Go back to **[Functional Programming in JavaScript](/blog/functional-programming-in-javascript/)** and replace loops with `sort` plus `map` or `filter`.
- Share with a friend who still writes `arr.sort((a, b) => a > b ? 1 : -1)`
