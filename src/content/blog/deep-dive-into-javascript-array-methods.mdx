If you just read my **[Functional Programming in JavaScript](/blog/functional-programming-in-javascript/)** post, you saw a few helpful array methods like `map` and `reduce`.

Here, we'll slow down and take each helper apart, like opening a toy car to see the gears.

We'll even build our own versions from scratch — think of them as simple, [_pure_ functions](/blog/functional-programming-in-javascript/#2-pure-functions-the-smallest-reliable-unit) — to truly understand how they work under the hood.

Feel free to copy-paste the code into your console and try things as we go.

## 0. Why bother?

Loops work.

But when the idea in your head is "do something to every item" or "keep only the red marbles," a loop is noisy.

Array methods let you say what you mean in one line.

---

## 1. `.forEach` — do something for every item

`forEach` doesn't give you a new array. It just runs a function once per item.

```js
const pets = ["cat", "dog", "hamster"];

pets.forEach((pet) => {
    console.log(pet.toUpperCase());
});
// CAT
// DOG
// HAMSTER
```

### Build your own

```js
function myForEach(array, callback) {
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        callback(array[i], i, array);
    }
}

myForEach(pets, (pet) => console.log(pet));
```

Notice we pass three things:

1.  the current value,
2.  the index,
3.  the whole array (rarely used, but free).

This `myForEach` isn't _pure_ because `console.log` has a side effect (writing to the console), but it shows the basic structure.

---

## 2. `.map` — turn one array into another

`map` is like `forEach`, but it **returns** a brand-new array full of whatever your callback gives back.

```js
const lengths = pets.map((pet) => pet.length);
console.log(lengths); // [3, 3, 7]
```

### Build your own

```js
function myMap(array, callback) {
    const result = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        result.push(callback(array[i], i, array));
    }
    return result;
}

console.log(myMap([1, 2, 3], (n) => n * 10)); // [10, 20, 30]
```

Key point: the original `array` stays the same. `map` is friendly that way. Our `myMap` function here _is_ pure if the callback you provide is also pure!

---

## 3. `.filter` — keep the items that pass the test

```js
const longNames = pets.filter((pet) => pet.length > 3);
console.log(longNames); // ["hamster"]
```

### Build your own

```js
function myFilter(array, callback) {
    const result = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        if (callback(array[i], i, array)) {
            result.push(array[i]);
        }
    }
    return result;
}

console.log(myFilter([1, 2, 3, 4], (n) => n % 2 === 0)); // [2, 4]
```

`filter` gives you a shorter (or equal) array, never longer. Again, `myFilter` is pure if its callback is.

---

## 4. `.reduce` — turn many values into one

`reduce` can feel scary because it is a blank canvas. It can sum numbers, build strings, even create objects.

```js
const numbers = [5, 10, 15];
const total = numbers.reduce((acc, n) => acc + n, 0);
console.log(total); // 30
```

1. The **first argument** of `reduce` is a callback.

    1. The **first parameter** of that callback is the "accumulator" (what we have so far).
    2. The **second parameter** is the current item.

2. The **second argument** of `reduce` (here `0`) is the starting value.

Like the others, `myReduce` is pure if the callback function maintains purity.

### Build your own

```js
function myReduce(array, callback, initial) {
    let acc = initial;
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        acc = callback(acc, array[i], i, array);
    }
    return acc;
}

const product = myReduce([2, 3, 4], (acc, n) => acc * n, 1);
console.log(product); // 24
```

#### Practical example: group by first letter

```js
const byFirstLetter = pets.reduce((acc, pet) => {
    const key = pet[0];
    acc[key] = [...(acc[key] || []), pet];
    return acc;
}, {});

console.log(byFirstLetter);
// { c: ["cat"], d: ["dog"], h: ["hamster"] }
```

### Where to next?

- Revisit the **[Functional Programming in JavaScript](/blog/functional-programming-in-javascript/)** article to see these helpers in a wider context.
- Try re-writing a `for` loop from your own project using `map`, `filter`, or `reduce`.

And of course, if this was helpful, share it with a friend who is still writing three nested loops.
